# ESP32_Round_CO2_Desktop_Sensor
This project is an Arduino ESP32 based CO2 sensor using a 1.28" round display. So far I've used oled and tft displays in square and rectagular shapes so this was an excuse to try a round one. The 3d printed enclosure is a friction fit with one screw holding the board in place. A fair amount of pressure is need to insert and remove the usb connector so this should help keep everything in place. I see this as an evolving project since the capacitive touch display is not used and there is plenty of room in the enclosure for other items.
